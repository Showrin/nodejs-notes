# nodejs-notes

Notes taken by me a Frontend Engineer while learning NodeJS to kick off his Full-stack career. I followed the course [The Complete Node.js Course](https://codewithmosh.com/p/the-complete-node-js-course). So if you did this course already, you'll see some similarities here. You can use it as a starter book for NodeJS.
