# nodejs-notes

Notes taken by me a Frontend Engineer while learning NodeJS to kick off his Full-stack career. I followed the course [The Complete Node.js Course](https://codewithmosh.com/p/the-complete-node-js-course). So if you did this course already, you'll see some similarities here. You can use it as a starter book for NodeJS.

## Getting Started

### What is NodeJS

NodeJS is a **Javascript runtime** **(not a programing language, not even a framework)**, built on top of **the fastest JS Engine V8 (the core of Google Chrome)**. NodeJS allows us to run the JS Engine outside the browser.

> Runtime is a special program that **supports the execution of computer programs written in a programing language**.

Before 2009, it's not possible to run Javascript code on server i.e. outside of browser. **In 2009, Ryan Dahl, an American Software Engineer**, came up with a brilliant idea. Every browser contains a JS engine inside and use it to execute JS programs. What he did is he integrated that engine in a C++ program. And that program is now known as NodeJS.
